# 11/21/2025 Edits

## Data & Loading

- Replaced the hard-coded sample data in `data-loader.js` with loaders that use the full World Bank dataset from `world-bank-data/`:
  - Joined `economy-and-growth/economy-and-growth.csv` (GDP and GDP per capita), `health/health.csv` (population), and `social-development/social-development.csv` (life expectancy) using country code and year.
  - Built `healthData[year]` as a panel of `{ country, countryCode, year, gdpPerCapita, lifeExpectancy, population, region }`.
  - Built `regionalGDPData[year]` as regional aggregates (GDP in trillions, population in millions) using World Bank regions mapped to our 7 display regions.
- Filtered out aggregate entities (e.g., “World”, “High income”, “OECD members”) by skipping rows without a proper World Bank region, so only real countries appear in all downstream charts.
- Added `whenDataReady()` and wired `main-new.js` to wait for data before rendering any visualization.

## Layout & Sizing

- Switched the visualization grid (`.viz-grid` in `style.css`) to a single-column layout so **only one plot spans the width of the page at a time**.
- Increased default visualization container heights and set all SVGs to `width: 100%; height: 100%` so `stream-graph`, `bubble-chart`, `radar-chart`, and `trajectory-chart` are comparable in footprint to the racing bar chart.

## Top 10 Countries Race

- Rewrote the race chart in `main-new.js` to:
  - Respect the metric dropdown (`Total GDP`, `Population`, `Life Expectancy`) via a shared metric config (`accessor` + `format`).
  - Use **Total GDP ≈ GDP per capita × population** for the GDP metric.
  - Display metric-appropriate labels (trillions for GDP, millions for population, years for life expectancy).
- Added a **year slider** (`race-year-slider` + `race-year-display`) so the user can scrub through time when the animation is paused.
- Made the play/pause button step through years using the same render function as the slider.

## Bubble Chart – Wealth, Health & Population

- Fixed bubble sizing by:
  - Ensuring population comes from the full `health.csv` and removing aggregate rows so only real countries are plotted.
  - Keeping GDP per capita on a log scale, life expectancy on a linear scale, and population mapped via a square-root radius scale.
- Result: large circles now correspond to truly high-population countries (e.g., China, India) instead of regional aggregates.

## Radar Chart – Development Indicators

- Normalized indicators as:
  - GDP per capita: 0–70,000 USD.
  - Life expectancy: 0–85 years.
  - Population (M): 0–1,500 million (population divided by 1,000,000 before normalization).
- Ensured the radar chart:
  - Uses 2020 data if available, otherwise falls back to the latest year in `healthData`.
  - Filters to real countries only and draws visible filled polygons plus per-country points and legend entries.

## Trajectory Chart – Development Paths

- Used the full `healthData` time series to plot connected scatter trajectories for selected countries (GDP per capita vs. life expectancy over time).
- Verified axes (log GDP per capita, linear life expectancy) and legends for clarity.

## Global Development Patterns – Choropleth Map

- Replaced the earlier 6-dot Mapbox demo with a **country-level choropleth** driven by `healthData`:
  - Uses Mapbox `country-boundaries` vector tiles joined to World Bank ISO3 codes (`countryCode`).
  - Colors every country we have data for, instead of just a few markers.
- Limited the indicator dropdown to:
  - GDP Per Capita.
  - Life Expectancy.
- Implemented **stable, dynamic color scales**:
  - Precomputed global domains across all years for GDP per capita and life expectancy.
  - For GDP per capita:
    - Used **log10 scaling** with outlier trimming (5th–95th percentile in log space).
    - Applied a multi-hue gradient **white → yellow → green → blue** via `d3.interpolateRgbBasis`.
  - For life expectancy:
    - Used a linear `Viridis` scale across global min–max.
- Fixed the legend to show the **full spectrum**:
  - For GDP: samples the color scale in log space but labels ticks with raw dollar values.
  - For life expectancy: samples and labels directly in years.

## General Fixes & Cleanups

- Ensured the race plot, bubble chart, radar, trajectories, and choropleth all:
  - Use the same `healthData` source.
  - Exclude aggregate World Bank entities.
  - Handle missing years gracefully (fallback to the nearest or latest valid year as appropriate).
